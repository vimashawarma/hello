### how to use

`for Windows Users`

1. install Python from <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.2/python-3.9.2-amd64.exe">here</a>. it is super important that checkbox `Add Python to PATH` is checked on setup.
2. open the file called `Install_Requirements.bat`. this will do everything for you with no issues, simple.
   
1. on your phone, open snapchat, create a shortcut with as many people as possible to spam snaps to.
2. download snapchat on your computer
3. login and allow permissions to your camera/microphone/etc
4. if you don't have a camera, download obs studio and get a virtual camera.
5. you may need to restart your pc if you only downloaded a virtual camera just now.
6. open the `main.py` script with python. select the start option and begin.
